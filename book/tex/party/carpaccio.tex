    \ingredients{%
        4  & Beetroot (elongated ones are the best) \\

        & Balsamic vinegar \\
        & Olive oil \\
        & Rocket \\
        & Pumpkin seed/pistachio
    }

    \preparation{%
        \step Cover washed raw beetroot in aluminium foil. Bake till tender (around 1-1.5h)
        \step Slices thinly. Sprinkle with olive oil, black pepper and balsamic vinegar.
        \step Scatter cheese, rocket and seeds. Add extra olive oil and balsamic vinegar.
    }

    \suggestion[Be efficient]
    {%
        It's a lot of faff to bake just a few beetroot. Instead, bake them when baking something different, as they're covered in foil, fragrances shouldn't permeate.
    }
