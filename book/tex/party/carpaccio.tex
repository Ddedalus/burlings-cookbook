    {Beetroot carpaccio}

    \introduction{%
        Easy salad, perfect for hot summer garden party or as a starter before fancy dinner.
    }

    \ingredients{%
        4 & Beetroots (elongated ones are the best) \\
        & Feta cheese \textbf{or} \\
        & goat cheese \\
        & Balsamic vinegar \\
        & Olive oil \\
        & Rocket \\
        & Pumpkin seed \textbf{or} \\
        & pistachio
    }

    \preparation{%
        \step Cover washed raw beetroot in aluminium foil.
        Bake till tender (around 1-1~\nicefrac{1}{2}h)
        \step Slices thinly.
        Sprinkle with olive oil, black pepper and balsamic vinegar.
        \step Scatter cheese, rocket and seeds.
        Add extra olive oil and balsamic vinegar.
    }

    \hint
    {%
        It's a lot of faff to bake just a few beetroots.
        Instead, bake them when baking something else.
        Since they're covered in foil, fragrances shouldn't permeate.
