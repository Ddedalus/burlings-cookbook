    {Orange dessert sauce}
    \introduction{%
        ***proportions are rough***

        Stuff crepes (with curd cheese are the best ones), pour over ice cream, make fond√©e... or eat straight from the pot!
        This sauce serves as a cherry on top!

    \ingredients{%
        \unit[100-150]{g} & Butter \\
        \unit[0.5-1]{c.} & Cane sugar \\
        3 & Oranges
    }

    \preparation{%
        \step In a deep frying pan or a pot with big diameter, melt butter.

        \step Add orange juice (squeeze oranges) and sugar.
        Simmer (so that you can observe small bubbles), without a lid, for 10 to 15 min.
    }

    \suggestion
    {%
        As this sauce is based on fat and sugar, and ideally all water evaporates during simmering, it can get dangerously hot.
        A minute of reheating in the microwave and the tupperware has melted...
    }

    \hint{%
        Sauce thickens as it cools down.
        However, if you suspect it's too running, add more sugar.
    }
