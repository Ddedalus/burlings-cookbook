    {Polish apple crumpets}
    \introduction{%
        This recipe encourages you to explore apples: you need to take an account on their tenderness - the more crisp and firm apple, the thinner the slices!
        How many kinds of apples do you know?
        Granny Smith doesn't count, if I had power, I would erase it!

        PS You don't need muffin rings, in Poland we actually prefer crumpets to be uneven and more oval.

    \hint{%
        I prefer to leave apple skin but you can peel it, especially if you use 'allotment apples' or some of the so called 'old kind' such as reinette.
