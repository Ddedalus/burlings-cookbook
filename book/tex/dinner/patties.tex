        Don't stir.
        \step Dice onion and chop parsley.

    \suggestion
    {%
        Serve either as burgers, or as main dish with roast vegetables.
        Mango chutney, good (why not home-made?) ketchup or garlic dip go well with patties.
    }
    \hint{%
        Watch out, it's very easy to burn sesame when roasting!
