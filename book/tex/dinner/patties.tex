    \preparation{%
        \step Cook millet: rinse with water, rinse well with boiling water, cook in 2.25 c.
        of hot salted water, covered, for 12-15 min.
        Don't stir.
        \step Dice onion and chop parsley.
        Mix all ingredients.
        \step If the mixture is not gluey enough, add more oil/flour.
        \step Form patties and put on baking paper.
        \step Bake at \unit[200]{\textcelcius} for 30 min, turn patties after 15 min.
    }

    \suggestion
    {%
        Serve either as burgers, in buns, or as main dish with roast vegetables.
        Mango chutney, good (why not home-made?) ketchup or garlic dip go well with patties.
    }
    \hint{%
        Watch out, it's very easy to burn sesame when roasting!
