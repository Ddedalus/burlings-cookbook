    {Carrot \textit{kopytka}}

    \introduction{%
        Potatoes are main ingredient of Polish cuisine.
        You can make all sorts of things out of them: \textit{kopytka, pyzy, kluski śląskie}... This recipe, however, is even better - it incorporates carrots to add colour, flavour and nutrients.
        It's also a perfect dish to smuggle vegetable for a poor eater.

        \step Cook \textit{kopytka} in hot water till tender
        (about 3 min from the moment when they started floating - as opposed to stay at the bottom of the pot).

        \step Heat frying pan with some oil.
