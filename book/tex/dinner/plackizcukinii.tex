    {Courgette 'potato pancakes'}
    \introduction{%
        First and foremost, it has nothing to do with a sweet crepes you would serve for breakfast.
        It's a savoury dish, traditionally made of potatoes, onion and flour; served with sour cream and salt or sugar (apparently half of Poland eats it with sugar, personally, I beg to differ...).

        What I present to you here is an upgraded version.
        Potatoes out, courgette in.

        You can serve with simply with sour cream or garlic dip, chilli sauce, chutney...
