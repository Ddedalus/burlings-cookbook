    \introduction{%
        People still haven't figured out why exactly stirring makes risotto so delicious.
        There are a few theories, covering even spread of heat and increased 'leakage' of starch from rice grains.
        Regardless of the reason, bear in mind that stirring,
        keeping the broth hot at all time and adding it in small portions are essential!

    \suggestion[]
    {%
        The larger the pan, the less stirring required as rice is heated more evenly.
