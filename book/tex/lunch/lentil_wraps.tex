    {Green lentil wraps}

    \ingredients{%
        8 & tortillas (wholemeal) \\
        \unit[100]{g} & green lentils \\
        1 & green pepper \\
        1 & onion \\
        & green beans \\
        & salad mix \\
        & green peas or mangout \\
        & grated cheese \\
        & salsa sauce
    }

    \preparation{%
        \step Boil lentils until soft in water (roughly three times the volume of the lentils), add salt.
        Boil the green peas in another pan.
        \step Fry onion and pepper on medium fire.
        \step Prepare a large, dry and clean, non-stick frying pan and keep it on minimum heat.
        On a flat surface mix all the ingredient on a tortilla and roll.
        To keep your fingers clean put the salsa at the bottom and the salad on the top.
        See the picture for rolling tips.
        \step Fry the wraps, turning by 90 degrees when they become brown and stiff.
    }

    \suggestion
    {%
        Put the filling only on the bottom half, leaving \unit[2]{cm} margin.
        Fold each side with both hands. Roll tightly, pushing in the sides with your pinkies.

    \hint{%
        While frying start with the place where the layers meet.
        Then turn as if you continued to roll it rather than unrolling on the pan!
