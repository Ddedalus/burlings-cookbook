    {Broccoli pesto}

    \introduction{%
        My grandma who cooks only traditional food fell in love in this pesto.
        I can recommend it more!

    \ingredients[13]{%
        1 & Broccoli with stem \\
        \unit[0.75]{c.} & Olive oil \\
        \unit[1]{c.} & Roasted almond (or sunflower seeds) \\
        4-5 & Garlic cloves \\
        1 & Onion, diced \\
        2cm & Ginger, diced \\
        3 & Garlic cloves, diced/pressed \\
        \nicefrac{1}{2} bunch & Parsley \\

        & Chili \\

    }

    \preparation{%
        \step Cut broccoli into pieces, cook on boiling water for 4-5 min.
        Drain and cool with cold water (preserve nice green colour).
        \step Blend everything.
        \step Voil√†!
    }

    \suggestion{%
        Serve with pasta, topped with cheese and cherry tomatoes.
        Or serve with bread.
        Or even with roast (as sauce) or raw vegetables (as dip).
    }

    \hint{%
        To roast almonds (or any other seeds/nuts), preheat the frying pan well (the thicker the frying pan, the better (eg cast-iron)), do not add any fat.
        Keep it at high heat, stir from time to time (not too often, though!
        Let them roast).
        Remember to transfer them immediately to a bowl/suitable tupperware as the frying pan is still hot after turning the hob off.
