    {Broccoli pesto}

    \introduction{%
        My grandma who cooks only traditional food fell in love in this pesto. I can recommend it more!
    }

    \ingredients{%
        1 & Broccoli (inc. stem) \\
        \unit[0.75]{c.} & Olive oil \\
        \unit[1]{c.} & Roasted almond (or sunflower seeds) \\
        4-5 & Garlic cloves \\
        1 & Onion, diced \\
        2cm & Ginger, diced \\
        3 & Garlic cloves, diced/pressed \\
        0.5 bunch & Parsley \\
        \unit[5]{tsp} & \underline{Yeast flakes} \\
        & Chili \\
        & Nutmeg \\
        & Lemon juice \\
        & Salt \& pepper
    }

    \preparation{%
        \step Cut broccoli into pieces, cook on boiling water for 4-5 min. Drain and cool with cold water (preserve nice green colour).
        \step Blend everything.
        \step Voil√†!
    }

    \suggestion{%
        Serve with pasta, topped with cheese and cherry tomatoes. Or serve with bread. Or even with roast (as sauce) or raw vegetables (as dip).
    }

    \hint{%
        To roast almonds (or any other seeds/nuts), preheat the frying pan well (the thicker the frying pan, the better (eg cast-iron)), do not add any fat. Keep it at high heat, stir from time to time (not too often, though! Let them roast). Remember to transfer them immediately to a bowl/suitable tupperware as the frying pan is still hot after turning the hob off.
