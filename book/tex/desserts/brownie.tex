    \prerecipeoverview{\vspace{5mm}}
    \introduction{%
        Aquafaba is the viscous water from chickpea can.
        Why should you be bothered?
        You could possibly exchange it for beaten egg whites but I always struggle what to do with leftover yolks.
        Aquafaba is a by-product and it's ingenious that it can be turned into desserts.
        Eat chickpea for lunch and aquafaba for afternoon tea - two birds with one stone!

    \preparation{%
        \step In a small pot heat up gently butter, chocolate and spices till chocolate melts.

        At the end add sugar in small portions.
        Gently mix with melted chocolate.

        \step In a separate bowl, mix flour and baking powder.

        \step Gently, in portions, add flour to liquid and stir with a spatula.

        \step Pour cake batter to a baking tin (small, something like 20x25) lined with parchment.
        Decorate with nuts, raspberries and chocolate.

        \step Bake at \unit[180]{\textcelcius} for 20 min.
        Do not overbake!
