    {Rhubarb compote}

    \introduction{%
        When you fancy something nice to drink but don't want to reach for rich in sugar juices - go for compote!
        You can prepare compote from pretty much any seasonal fruit.
        My favourite one is rhubarb compote (M.), then plum and White Transparent apple (not sure if you can get theme here...).
